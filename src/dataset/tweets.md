From my drafted congressional testimony in December, https://t.co/VpfEhaHJF6 https://t.co/c97crYDh0Y, I'm glad Mr. Ray is finally paying lip service to turning the exchange back on after months of squashing such efforts!

I'm still waiting for him to finally admit FTX US is solvent and give customers their money back...

https://t.co/XjcyYFsoU0

https://t.co/SdvMIMXQ5K, @fed_speak yeah sorry about that I had like 1 hour to throw this one together and it's ugly af

but also it's right, @K_L0X @MetaLawMan honestly you're pointing out one of the most infuriating things about this whole process

if the person with control of the system turns it off and withholds information on it, it's really hard for anyone else to prove anything about it, TL;DR:

1) S&amp;C files, claiming FTX US is insolvent
2) S&amp;C forgot to include bank balances, ~$428m
3) Once you add those back in, you get in the neighborhood of my prior balance sheet (~+$350m)
4) Other slides in the same filing demonstrate (2), @jconorgrogan @austerity_sucks I think FTX US was always solvent, with segregated assets from FTX International

this wasn't a last-minute musical chairs thing

to be clear if Alameda had excess assets (+ve NAV) on FTX US at the end, *those* would likely go to FTX intl but wouldn't be counted for FTX US anyway, @jconorgrogan I'm fairly confident that FTX US's excess cash on hand is much larger than the size of the wrapped asset issue to the extent there is one, @spreekaway https://t.co/8fa4tZsMr5, @MetaLawMan https://t.co/8fa4tZsMr5, FTX US is solvent, as it always as been.

https://t.co/XjcyYFsoU0 https://t.co/kn9Wm9wxjl, @TiffanyFong_ sometimes the world needs to see something, you know?, @AFTXcreditor a) they weren't in estate
b) nonetheless my lawyers offered &gt;&gt; 90% of it for customers
c) or 100% if D&amp;O obligations were honored

That being said, this was super clumsily done on our side. https://t.co/tCnlSIxkNp, @AFTXcreditor so I think the actual answer here is the following, roughly, as of ~November 10th:

1) ~$11.5b of assets (some on FTX), ~$3.5b of which were highly liquid
2) ~$1.5b of non-FTX liabilities
3) ~$10b of FTX liabilities

so you can get $8b as (10 - (3.5 - 1.5))

or $11.5b raw, @AFTXcreditor @MetaLawMan alas I think reporters have not been particularly interested in stories about FTX customer/creditor recovery or the chapter 11 process, @wasscast @itsmadeofcheese @wassielawyer tell me more about Wasscast!, @compound248 Reasonable thread!

And yeah I didn't realize it would ask for contributions, I turned that off just now :P, @QuintenFrancois wait FTX definitely wasn't spending $180m/year on Amazon delivery costs

I think your units are probably off somewhere there?, @ceostroff @Vlajournaliste heh whoops that was unintentional, good catch--think there shouldn't be a paying option anymore..., https://t.co/XVd0BPHxEU, @wassielawyer yup my sense is that is and always has been the best recovery scenario for customers.  I think that them being made substantially whole is a real possibility; I think we were possibly a few weeks away from getting there in November.  (US is solvent, should make everyone whole.), @friedmandave honestly there was no grand plan for the reply, I wouldn't read too much into it

(sorry, I guess you might have to mute this thread too...), @CryptoHayes I obviously disagree strongly with many of the specific FTX-related claims here, but:

I largely agree with your higher level point.

It's a variant on something I heard again and again oversees.

I think you might be a bit surprised by my perspective on it., @friedmandave correlation of official marks of private companies can be 0 for a surprisingly long time though :P, I believe it is likely the case that various legit legs of FTX have the ability to access these funds; hopefully that's what's happening here.  If not, hopefully one steps in soon to do so.  I would be happy to help advise regulators on this if any wanted., None of these are me.  I'm not and couldn't be moving any of those funds; I don't have access to them anymore.

https://t.co/5Gkin30Ny5, @tier10k If this is true then I wasn't a member of that inner circle

(I'm quite sure it's just false; I have never heard of such a group), @cz_binance Among other things, as you know, you didn't even have the rights to pull out as an investor unless we chose to buy you out--much of the tokens/equity were still locked., @cz_binance You threatened to walk at the last minute if we didn't kick in an extra ~$75m.

We did it anyway because this just made us feel more confident we didn't want Binance on our cap table.

But again, none of this is necessary.  You won.  Why are you lying about this now?, @cz_binance You won, @cz_binance.

There's no need to lie, now, about the buyout.

We initiated conversations around buying you out, and we decided to do it because it was important for our business.

And while I was frustrated with your 'negotiation' tactics, I chose to still do it., 3) I had thought of myself as a model CEO, who wouldn't become lazy or disconnected.

Which made it that much more destructive when I did.

I'm sorry.  Hopefully people can learn from the difference between who I was and who I could have been., 2) I will try to be helpful during the hearing, and to shed what light I can on:

--FTX US's solvency and American customers

--Pathways that could return value to users internationally

--What I think led to the crash

--My own failings, 1) I still do not have access to much of my data -- professional or personal.  So there is a limit to what I will be able to say, and I won't be as helpful as I'd like.

But as the committee still thinks it would be useful, I am willing to testify on the 13th., @cryptomanran I continue to think that this would be a productive path for parties to explore!  I *hope* that the teams in place will do so., I made a lot of big mistakes this year.

But this wasn't one of them.  There's no evidence, because it didn't happen.  Please, please, focus on your own house., Rep. Waters, and the House Committee on Financial Services:

Once I have finished learning and reviewing what happened, I would feel like it was my duty to appear before the committee and explain.

I'm not sure that will happen by the 13th.  But when it does, I will testify., @AltcoinPsycho if those controlling it wanted to continue processing ACH withdrawals then I would expect that would likely be true, @AltcoinDailyio yea the picture going around was a joke, I'm still vegan, Expanding on DealBook:

When I filed, I'm fairly sure FTX US was solvent, and that all US customers could be made whole.

To my knowledge, it still is today.

I was expecting that to happen.  I'm surprised it hasn't.  I'm not sure why US withdrawals were turned off., @fintechfrank agreed, we should do one, @dadadadaffy FTX US custodied its own assets., @dadadadaffy https://t.co/X1OzE3K9S8

~$53m in FTX US solBTC it looks like, so I don't think that should break it.  (I say this without knowing, right now, whether there even is an issue with solBTC to begin with.), @fintechfrank I believe it is true of the full FTX US exchange, not just LedgerX.

At the very least it was true prior to filing, to the best of my knowledge, and I was fully expecting withdrawals to remain open., @BillAckman @SBF I deeply appreciate that.

I messed up.  I'm going to do everything I can to make it right--even though I knew it might never be enough., Iâ€™ll be speaking with @andrewrsorkin at the @dealbook summit next Wednesday (11/30)., 32) Anyway -- none of that matters now.

What matters is doing the best I can.

And doing everything I can for FTX's customers., 31) And in the future, I'm going to care less about the dumb, contentless, "good actor" framework.

What matters is what you do--is *actually* doing good or bad, not just *talking* about doing good or *using ESG language*., 30) (Some of what I said was thoughtless or overly strong--I was venting and not intending that to be public.  I guess at this point what I write leaks anyway.), 29) Which means that interacting with regulatory structures can be really frustrating: a *huge* amount of work--much of it arbitrary--and relatively little customer protection.

Fuck that.  You all deserve frameworks that let regulators protect customers while allowing freedom., 28) Even so, there are regulators who have deeply impressed me with their knowledge and thoughtfulness.  The CFTC has; the SCB, and VARA, too.  And others, scattered.

But most are overwhelmed., 27) A few thoughts:

a) It's *really* hard to be a regulator.  They have an impossible job: to regulate entire industries that grow faster than their mandate allows them to.

And so often they end up mostly unable to police as well as they ideally would., 26) Well, that gives some color, I guess.

It sucks.  I'm really sorry that things ended up as they did.  And as I said--I'm going to do everything I can to make it more right., 25) Last night I talked to a friend of mine.

They published my messages.  Those were not intended to be public, but I guess they are now. https://t.co/yH9aKmESY8, 24) Shrapnel, 23) Roughly 25% of customer assets were withdrawn each day--$4b.

As it turned out, I was wrong: leverage wasn't ~$5b, it was ~$13b.

$13b leverage, total run on the bank, total collapse in asset value, all at once.

Which is why you don't want that leverage.

---, 22) And that risk was correlated--with the other collateral, and with the platform.

And then the crash came.

In a few day period, there was a historic crash--over 50% in most correlated assets, with no bid side liquidity.

And at the same time there was a run on the bank., 21) And problems were brewing.  Larger than I realized.

[AGAIN THESE NUMBERS ARE APPROXIMATE, TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE, ETC.]

Leverage built up-- ~$5b of leverage, backed by ~$20b of assets which were....

Well, they had value.  FTT had value, in EV!  But they had risk., 20) I was on the cover of every magazine, and FTX was the darling of Silicon Valley.

We got overconfident and careless., 19) Once upon a time--a month ago--FTX was a valuable enterprise.

FTX had ~$10-15b of daily volume, and roughly $1b of annual revenue.  $40b of equity value.

And we were held as paragons of running an effective company., 18) Truth and Beauty, 17) I know you've all seen this, but here's where things stand today, roughly speaking.  [LOTS OF CAVEATS, ETC.]

Liquid: -$8b
Semi: +$5.5b
Illiquid: +$3.5b

And yeah, maybe that $9b illiquid M2M isn't worth $9b (+$1b net).

OTOH--a month ago it was worth $18b; +$10b net.

---, 16) Maybe I'll fail.  Maybe I won't get anything more for customers than what's already there.

I've certainly failed before.  You all know that now, all too well.

But all I can do is to try.  I've failed enough for the month.

And part of me thinks I might get somewhere., 15) A few weeks ago, FTX was handling ~$10b/day of volume and billions of transfers.

But there was too much leverage--more than I realized.  A run on the bank and market crash exhausted liquidity.

So what can I try to do?  Raise liquidity, make customers whole, and restart., 14) My goal:

a) Clean up and focus on transparency
b) Make customers whole, 13) My goalâ€”my one goalâ€”is to do right by customers.

Iâ€™m contributing what I can to doing so.  Iâ€™m meeting in-person with regulators and working with the teams to do what we can for customers.

And after that, investors.  But first, customers., 12) To the best of my knowledge, as of post-11/7, with the potential for errors:

a) Alameda had more assets than liabilities M2M (but not liquid!)
b) Alameda had margin position on FTX Intl
c) FTX US had enough to repay all customers

Not everyone necessarily agrees with this, 11) I'll get to what happened.  But for now, let's talk about where we are today., 10) [NOT LEGAL ADVICE.  NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE.  THIS IS ALL AS I REMEMBER IT, BUT MY MEMORY MIGHT BE FAULTY IN PARTS.], 9) D, 8) E, 7) N, 6) E, 5) P, 4) P, 3) A, 2) H, 1) What, 5) I'm piecing together all of the details, but I was shocked to see things unravel the way they did earlier this week.

I will, soon, write up a more complete post on the play by play, but I want to make sure that I get it right when I do., 4) I'm going to work on giving clarity on where things are in terms of user recovery ASAP., 3) This doesn't necessarily have to mean the end for the companies or their ability to provide value and funds to their customers chiefly, and can be consistent with other routes.

Ultimately I'm optimistic that Mr. Ray and others can help provide whatever is best., 2) I'm really sorry, again, that we ended up here.

Hopefully things can find a way to recover.  Hopefully this can bring some amount of transparency, trust, and governance to them.

Ultimately hopefully it can be better for customers., 1) Hi all:

Today, I filed FTX, FTX US, and Alameda for voluntary Chapter 11 proceedings in the US., @BillAckman @FTX_Official I deeply appreciate this.  I'm going to keep fighting, as best I can, for users., We hope this is just step one: beginning to find ways to bring liquidity to users.

That is the core thing that I am fighting for right now, and will continue to fight for in whatever ways I can., 22) And, finally:

I sincerely apologize.

We'll keep sharing updates as we have them., 21) NOT ADVICE, OF ANY KIND, IN ANY WAY

I WAS NOT VERY CAREFUL WITH MY WORDS HERE, AND DO NOT MEAN ANY OF THEM IN A TECHNICAL OR LEGAL SENSE; I MAY WELL HAVE NOT DESCRIBED THINGS RIGHT though I'm trying to be transparent.  I'M NOT A GOOD DEV AND PROBABLY MISDESCRIBED SOMETHING., 20) At some point I might have more to say about a particular sparring partner, so to speak.

But you know, glass houses.  So for now, all I'll say is:

well played; you won., 19) A few other assorted comments:

This was about FTX International.  FTX US, the US based exchange that accepts Americans, was not financially impacted by this shitshow.

It's 100% liquid.  Every user could fully withdraw (modulo gas fees etc).

Updates on its future coming., 18) But all of that isn't what matters right now--what matters right now is trying to do right by customers.  That's it., 17) All of the stakeholders would have a hard look at FTX governance.  I will not be around if I'm not wanted.

All of the stakeholders--investors, regulators, users--would have a large part to play in how it would be run.

Solely trust., 16) Second, in any scenario in which FTX continues operating, its first priority will be radical transparency--transparency it probably always should have been giving.

Giving as close to on-chain transparency as it can: so that people know  *exactly* what is happening on it., 15) First, one way or another, Alameda Research is winding down trading.

They aren't doing any of the weird things that I see on Twitter--and nothing large at all.  And one way or another, soon they won't be trading on FTX anymore., 14) So, what does this mean going forward?

I'm not sure--that depends on what happens over the next week.

But here are some things I know., 13) Because at the end of the day, I was CEO, which means that *I* was responsible for making sure that things went well.  *I*, ultimately, should have been on top of everything.

I clearly failed in that.  I'm sorry., 12) Every penny of that--and of the existing collateral--will go straight to users, unless or until we've done right by them.

After that, investors--old and new--and employees who have fought for what's right for their career, and who weren't responsible for any of the fuck ups., 11) There are a number of players who we are in talks with, LOIs, term sheets, etc.

We'll see how that ends up., 10) So, right now, we're spending the week doing everything we can to raise liquidity.

I can't make any promises about that.  But I'm going to try.  And give anything I have to if that will make it work., 9) Anyway: right now, my #1 priority--by far--is doing right by users.

And I'm going to do everything I can to do that.  To take responsibility, and do what I can., 8) And so we are where we are.  Which sucks, and that's on me.

I'm sorry., 7) And so I was off twice.

Which tells me a lot of things, both specifically and generally, that I was shit at.

And a third time, in not communicating enough.  I should have said more.  I'm sorry--I was slammed with things to do and didn't give updates to you all., 6) My sense before:

Leverage: 0x
USD liquidity ready to deliver: 24x average daily withdrawals

Actual:

Leverage: 1.7x
Liquidity: 0.8x Sunday's withdrawals

Because, of course, when it rains, it pours.  We saw roughly $5b of withdrawals on Sunday--the largest by a huge margin., 5) The full story here is one I'm still fleshing out every detail of, but as a very high level, I fucked up twice.

The first time, a poor internal labeling of bank-related accounts meant that I was substantially off on my sense of users' margin.  I thought it was way lower., 4) FTX International currently has a total market value of assets/collateral higher than client deposits (moves with prices!).

But that's different from liquidity for delivery--as you can tell from the state of withdrawals.  The liquidity varies widely, from very to very little., 3) So here's an update on where things are.

[THIS IS ALL ABOUT FTX INTERNATIONAL, THE NON-US EXCHANGE.  FTX US USERS ARE FINE!]

[TREAT ALL OF THESE NUMBERS AS ROUGH.  THERE ARE APPROXIMATIONS HERE.], 2) I also should have been communicating more very recently.

Transparently--my hands were tied during the duration of the possible Binance deal; I wasn't particularly allowed to say much publicly.  But of course it's on me that we ended up there in the first place., 1) I'm sorry.  That's the biggest thing.

I fucked up, and should have done better., 6) (Note that https://t.co/fCrWGQ4y7w and https://t.co/Ju8CkfrLYHâ€“two separate companiesâ€“are not currently impacted by this.  https://t.co/fCrWGQ4y7wâ€™s withdrawals are and have been live, is fully backed 1:1, and operating normally.), 5) I know that there have been rumors in media of conflict between our two exchanges, however Binance has shown time and again that they are committed to a more decentralized global economy while working to improve industry relations with regulators. We are in the best of hands., 4) A *huge* thank you to CZ, Binance, and all of our supporters. This is a user-centric development that benefits the entire industry. CZ has done, and will continue to do, an incredible job of building out the global crypto ecosystem, and creating a freer economic world., 3) But the important thing is that customers are protected., 2) Our teams are working on clearing out the withdrawal backlog as is. This will clear out liquidity crunches; all assets will be covered 1:1. This is one of the main reasons weâ€™ve asked Binance to come in. It may take a bit to settle etc. -- we apologize for that., 1) Hey all: I have a few announcements to make.

Things have come full circle, and https://t.co/DWPOotRHcXâ€™s first, and last, investors are the same: we have come to an agreement on a strategic transaction with Binance for https://t.co/DWPOotRHcX (pending DD etc.)., @udiWertheimer @cz_binance I'm in; let's do it!, @TheCoolRas @UpOnlyTV I'd be happy to go on @UpOnlyTV!, @ByzGeneral I mean that's up to her to answer but they said they were worried about impact which this would solve for them, and this is just quicker and easier

but if they want to TWAP sell over a few months that's cool too, 5) As always -- a huge thank you to our supporters.

And to everyone else, as well, as long as they keep building and keep moving the industry forward.

We'll keep building too., 4) And in the end you should do what you want, and trade where you want.  We're grateful to those who stay; and when this blows over we'll welcome everyone else back., 3)  We've already processed billions of dollars of deposits/withdrawals today; we'll keep going.  (Taking up anti-spam checks to process more--sorry if you got those.  We're hitting node rate capacity, will keep going.)  Also tons of USD &lt;&gt; stablecoin conversions going on., 2) A bunch of unfounded rumors have been circulating.  You can see https://t.co/EBmqPhqCBl.

FTX keeps audited financials etc.  And, though it slows us down sometimes on product, we're highly regulated., 1) A huge thank you to everyone who has supported us--we're excited to keep climbing together.

And especially to those who stay level headed during crazy times.  We deeply appreciate it., @miked_14 @cz_binance whoops true dat, @basedkarbon ikr?, @mjpldn heh yeah working on it, 5) Because I respect the hell out of what y'all have done to build the industry as we see it today, whether or not they reciprocate, and whether or not we use the same methods.

Including CZ.

Anyway -- as always -- it's time to build.

Make love (and blockchain), not war., 4) Anyway I was going to write a different thread, but I took a deep breath and reminded myself of something we'd all do well to remember:

that we're all in this together, and I wish the best to *everyone* driving the industry forward., 3) It works domestically and internationally.  It works with relatives and with employees.

Because that's how blockchain works:

it just works., 2) Seriously SEND is awesome.

It's the omni box for money (soon we'll merge blockchain into the same box!)

Right now, sending money internationally is a pain in the ass.  People are paying 10's of percent's, waiting weeks, and hoping that it lands.

Crypto can do better., 1) Posting about what everything wants to know more about:

SEND! https://t.co/yprL7EHCWS, @prestige_nfts Mondays!

https://t.co/vhIDkCuNOk https://t.co/DMZz2n17DO, @ChadMeyer_ @SatoshiFlipper &lt;3, @ChadMeyer_ @SatoshiFlipper idk -- I'd love to find a way to do it!  I'm seeing what we can do, but really no promises there.  (NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE, NOT LEGAL ADVICE), @SatoshiFlipper well timed

[NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE], @SOLanaBets07 oh yeah I'm totes happy to pay $8 for it tbh I'm confused why people are making such a big deal of the change, @AutismCapital ok, BTW on the blue check marks:

so far the discourse has centered around them as vanity, but remember that for people in finance, they help weed out scammers posing as someone else

also this post is gonna get a lot of scammer spam isn't it, @koreanjewcrypto https://t.co/ZeuKjzP36Y, @keaton @GreenPartyUS re: green party --

would love to see approval voting; then it's fine to vote 3rd party without giving up your influence on D vs R!, @gavinmclelland FWIW I think that the much bigger worry is dual-use research

some if it is *wildly* dangerous, 5) (As an aside: when I talk about pandemic prevention, I really do mean *prevention*.

We should be working to stop the next pandemic *before* it happens, not imposing restrictive mandates for this one.), 4) Excited to see what happens on Tuesday!, 3) If you want to contribute crypto, reach out to your elected officials and ask if they accept it; FTX is happy to sign them up!, 2) As part of this, @rsalame7926 and I signed up campaigns to accept crypto; and gave some, including millions to Senate &amp; House Republicans., 1) I was a significant donor in both D and R primaries.

Supporting constructive candidates across the aisle to prevent pandemics and bring a bipartisan climate to DC.

And working with them to support permissionless finance., @pengyong321 just checked to make sure -- I can confirm that FTX is not a candidate in the midterm elections

our legal team informed us that companies are not permitted to run, and also that FTX is not the requisite 25 years old to run for congress anyway, @sasuke___420 innovation, that is, @udiWertheimer oops, Max funding rates never really made sense to me.  If the fair rate is very negative then bounding funding rates just makes perps illiquid., @lex_node I once ate a grape and I

realized the tokens I like arenâ€™t securities either

[NOT LEGAL ADVICE], @jay_ftx @BanklessHQ @ErikVoorhees I've read it waaay too many times

have a whole catalogue of things that are good and bad about it :P, @TheStalwart "value creators like oil/gas"

To some extent I agree, especially in an energy crunch, but this certainly doesn't square with the administration's rhetoric on oil and gas, @hbarsojourner @ErikVoorhees oh yeah 100% happy to do that!, We're excited to help return the assets quickly to customers, @hbarsojourner @ErikVoorhees basically a sense of "how reasonable, according to DC norms, is actor X being, and how much does that make me want to accommodate them?", @twobitidiot @ErikVoorhees oh yeah sorry 100% agree with that

I think the CT discourse on DeFi in general is super helpful

I think the specific targeting of the bill in a super public way less so (but again maybe I'm wrong!), @robustus @ErikVoorhees hopefully we can avoid that, @setanimals @ErikVoorhees *I* think I am!

But some others don't seem to think I am and I don't want to be presumptuous or put words in their mouth., @ErikVoorhees My strong instinct--as I predicted--is that this approach is in fact already predictably backfiring and causing the exact opposite reaction of what is desired.  But again, hopefully I'm wrong., @ErikVoorhees But it doesn't really matter what I think, it matters what you guys think, and how effective you guys are at getting your voices heard.

FWIW, word is that so far, the CT blowback has rallied *more* support on capitol hill behind regulating DeFi.  Hopefully rumors are wrong., @ErikVoorhees It depends on the final language, as I've said many times.

*If* the final language protects DeFi, then I'm strongly in favor of it passing this year.  If it doesn't, I'm not.

There are a few remaining language chocies that will be *very* relevant for its impact on DeFi., 6) Annualizing this out, and netting out staking, you get something like:

Revenue: $2b
Expenses: $3.2b

Once again, the vast majority of expenses seem to be headcount--roughly 80%.

They have roughly $6b on hand., 5) My reading of this is, roughly:

a) $145m of the difference is encumbered capital which will be returned
b) $100m or so of loss to FX moving

So something like a real loss of $400m, and a 'predictive' loss of $300m., 4) Once again, partially ignore the staking revenue, it's likely mostly passing through to customers and offset by an expense item.

In terms of expenses and EBITDA--it's a little tricky to parse exactly.

They report $545m loss and adjusted EBITDA of $116m loss., 3) Once again, the vast majority of their transaction revenue was retail -- around 95%.

Of their other revenue--now ~25% of their total--'interest income' is the most interesting one.  About $20m of this seems to be on Coinbase, and the other ~$80m of it from USDC., 2) Overall, bear markets suck for retail.

Coinbase's revenue, and volume, were down a fair bit; their retail volume in particular was down ~45% quarterly.

(The flip side--lots of growth potential in the next bull market!) https://t.co/D20qtlxpPZ, 1) Alright alright, Coinbase 2022Q3 earnings:

https://t.co/aoE8f1XuJV

previous: https://t.co/LtSROD69kB, @HsakaTrades workin on it..., welcome!, @Lolpual1 @BanklessHQ I totally haven't given up yet!

I'm just preemptively putting that there because if I don't people will say "oooh but what about when you were asked about strategic tradeoffs"?

And because, frankly, I think it's important, rhetorically (though I could be wrong!), @Lolpual1 @BanklessHQ yeah totally agree--we should keep fighting for it

FWIW I do think that regulation can help that fight *to the extent that it provides oversight of centralized exchanges while not interfering with DeFi*, taking some heat off of the rest of the space

But depends on details, @SirZacc @KelseyTuoc working on it!

at the end of the day that's a question for the CFTC but we've put together a margin amendment we're proud of, @RNR_0 hm yeah good question @elonmusk how much would someone have to pay per month to get out of all other monetization/have their data be private/not see any ads?, @KelseyTuoc yeah he's had a few warnings but every time we try to reassign him wendy won't stop barking, @Lolpual1 @BanklessHQ I would too!  And I would fight against that happening.

There may come a day where we have to make a tough strategic call as a community but I hope it doesn't, and I don't know for sure what the right call there would be., or else we hear about it the next morning from wendy https://t.co/CTf2EsRV2C, to be fair we have a broad top-down mandate to be positive about gopher when we write about him https://t.co/YaeqshgZhA, @BanklessHQ yeah it's a fuckin mess

https://t.co/Ko8HMBUkZq, @daarfield check out https://t.co/Ko8HMBUkZq, @CAD6119 looking into what we can do there!  tricky regulatory thing, @crypto_bitlord7 https://t.co/3TDado00ow, @davekarpf heh the court records were, for some reason, missing some messages :P, 2) In some ways it mirrors https://t.co/c1B48cJpql:

a) Twitter needed a revamping of leadership, so Elon did that

b) now Twitter has strong leadership, and we're excited for Elon to execute *his* vision for it, 1) we passed on Twitter b/c it didn't seem like our strengths were what was needed for Elon's vision for Twitter

(e.g. if he wanted to do blockchain-based social media, or blockchain wallets/payments, we'd have been excited to work on that!

and who knows, maybe he still will), @friedmandave @mayazi fwiw we're generally excited to be back-end infrastructure/etc. for things like this, @John_CF @LucidCiC &lt;3

yup working on it -- sorry about the delays here!  We know we have to get deposits/withdrawals live soon come rain or shine, @cardano_whale @Clintchimera ah yeah sorry I mean "new" as in "not currently on FTX", @basedkarbon could be closing a short, thought, too!, USE WITH CAUTION
