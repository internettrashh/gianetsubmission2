# GaiaNet AI Chat with SBF

This project is a React-based web application that simulates a conversation with an AI version of sam bankaman fried, a prominent figure in artificial intelligence. The app leverages GaiaNet's decentralized AI inference network to generate responses in the style and perspective of sam bankman fried.

## About GaiaNet

GaiaNet provides decentralized AI inference via public and private hosted nodes. This approach offers several advantages:
- Distributed computing power
- Increased reliability and fault tolerance
- Potential for lower latency depending on node proximity

## How It Works


1. The application uses a large language model accessed through GaiaNet's decentralized network.
2. The model is fine-tuned with approximately 200 scraped tweets from SBF's Twitter account.
3. These tweets are used to create a system prompt that guides the AI to respond in a manner similar to SBF's writing style, opinions, and areas of expertise.
4. When a user sends a message, it's sent along with this system prompt to the GaiaNet API.
5. The API returns a response generated by the AI model, which is then displayed in the chat interface.

This approach allows the AI to mimic SBF's communication style and knowledge base, creating a more authentic conversational experience.

## Features

- Chat interface with AI-generated responses mimicking SBF's style
- Utilizes GaiaNet's decentralized AI inference network
- AI responses based on ~200 scraped tweets from SBF
- Suggested conversation topics
- Real-time message updates
- Responsive design
